Streetfighter-Game
==================

Intended user experience: The page loads, we see Ryu standing still. We hover the mouse over Ryu, and he shifts to his ready pose. We stop hovering over Ryu, and he goes back to standing still. We click on Ryu, and he leans forward and throws a Hadouken. He remains in that pose until we release our click, which causes Ryu to return to his ready pose. When we hit the “x” key, Ryu assumes his looking cool pose, and when we release “x”, he returns to his ready pose.
